## 📋 Project Overview
micro-MediDetect-age is a fully functional **disease diagnosing website using face recognition
technology made using Agile development methodology** as part of the Microsoft Engage 2022
program. 


## 🔖 Introduction
	
Taking a pulse is a very important part of heart health checks. A person's resting heart rate is a major factor in determining a person's risk of a heart attack. So, what if you could determine the pulse rate with just using webcam/camera?   Early detection of Genetic Diseases  help in early intervention and treatment, which may either cure the disease or improve the outcome of the patient but still doctors struggle to recognize as they don't spend much time with them.
												    
Keeping all this in mind, introducting you my project micro-MediDetect-age...
												    
micro-MediDetect-age is a non-invasive and no cost diagnosis solution to check pulse rate and genetic diseases remotely and safely.
